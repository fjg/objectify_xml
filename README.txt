= Objectify::Xml

* http://github.com/pangloss/objectify_xml

== DESCRIPTION:

Provides an easy to use DSL resembling ActiveRecord for defining objects
representing any XML document, including deeply nested ones. This project
was extracted from my ruby-picasa gem. You can find ruby-picasa at 
http://github.com/pangloss/ruby-picasa or available as a gem.

require 'objectify_xml'
require 'objectify_xml/atom' # optional

Atom support is significant but may be incomplete. Please submit your
improvements or support for additional formats, preferably via github.

== FEATURES:

* Capture and typecast standard attributes
* Define both has_one and has_many nested element 'associations'
* Significant (if not full) namespace support
* Cleanly ignore unknown attributes and namespaces
* Support documents that nest data unnecessarily without creating bogus
  associated objects.
* Inheritable object definitions

== PROBLEMS:

* None known.

== SYNOPSIS:

The following are functioning early definitions for some of the objects used in
ruby-picasa in their entirety:

module RubyPicasa
  class PhotoUrl < Objectify::Xml::ElementParser
    attr_accessor :url, :height, :width
  end

  class Album < Objectify::Xml::DocumentParser
    attributes :id,
      :published,
      :updated,
      :title,
      :summary,
      :rights,
      :gphoto_id,
      :name,
      :access,
      :numphotos, 
      :total_results, 
      :start_index,
      :items_per_page,
      :allow_downloads
    has_many :links, Objectify::Atom::Link, 'link'
    has_many :entries, :Photo, 'entry'
    has_one :content, PhotoUrl, 'media:content'
    has_many :thumbnails, PhotoUrl, 'media:thumbnail'
    flatten 'media:group'
    namespaces %w[openSearch gphoto media]
  end

  class Photo < Objectify::Xml::DocumentParser
    attributes :id,
      :published,
      :updated,
      :title,
      :summary,
      :gphoto_id,
      :version, 
      :position,
      :albumid,
      :width,
      :height,
      :description,
      :keywords
    has_many :links, Objectify::Atom::Link, 'link'
    has_one :content, PhotoUrl, 'media:content'
    has_many :thumbnails, PhotoUrl, 'media:thumbnail'
    namespaces %w[gphoto media]
    flatten 'media:group'
  end
end
